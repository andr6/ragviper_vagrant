# ragviper_vagrant
I took the Vagrantfile and shell script for Ragpicker(https://github.com/compoterhacker/Ragpicker) from https://github.com/intelemetry/ragpicker_bash and spruced it up a bit, and by that I mean swapped out vxcage for viper(https://viper.li/). I think the script works but haven't tried it. You can do it though.
